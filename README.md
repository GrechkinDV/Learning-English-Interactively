# Learning-English-Interactively
Made with Python, Tkinter. The main purpose was to help own students to overcome learning process difficulties.

Though structure and words of English language aren't too complicated, surprising percentage of begginners becomes demotivated on primary steps. The best solution to support my students was:
Creating an app that helps memorizing words' spelling and meaning, provides ability to get keen on idioms along with their practical usage. Finally, suggests a simple XO(Tic-tac-toe) game to take some rest.
App contains three parts:
-Words(Easy, Medium, Hard levels)
-Idioms
-Tic Tac Toe(single player).

Interface is double lingual(Azerbaijani and Russian).
Dataset of word-translation, idiom-maening pairs is expandable directly from the application. Database is stored in sqlite3 format.
